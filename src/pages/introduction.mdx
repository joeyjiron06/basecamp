This repository serves as a centralized archive for my collection of code snippets, which are frequently repurposed across various projects. One might contemplate the feasibility of disseminating these through npm or establishing GitHub templates. However, I find that selectively copying and adapting code to suit the unique requirements of each project is more efficient, given the distinct nature of each initiative. Utilizing a template often entails inheriting unnecessary constraints associated with specific frameworks or build processes. 

As my endeavors do not uniformly subscribe to a single build system or set of dependencies, this repository offers a versatile array of 'legos' that I can seamlessly integrate and tailor to the demands of any given project.
