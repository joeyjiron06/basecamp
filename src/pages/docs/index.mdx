  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.</p>
</hgroup>


This is **NOT** a CSS framework/library. It is a collection of reusable CSS that you can copy and paste into your apps to build your own CSS design system.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.


### FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why copy/paste and not an npm package?</summary>

The concept here is to empower you with ownership and control over the code, enabling you to determine how the components are constructed and styled.

Copy these beautiful defaults, then customize the css to your needs.

Packaging styles within an npm package has a drawback: it tightly couples the style with the implementation. Ideally, the design of your components should remain distinct from their implementation.
