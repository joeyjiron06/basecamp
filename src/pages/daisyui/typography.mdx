In the [Config](./config.mdx) doc, I already installed `@tailwindcss/typography`, however, that only applies to elements where the parent contains a `prose` class. There are many other instances where default styling of text is desired. 

Below is the code for setting default styling in the app

<Code lang="postcss" code={TypographyCSS} />
