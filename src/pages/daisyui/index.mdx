subtitle: Snippets for a classless version of DaisyUI
---

DaisyUI is a comprehensive framework that offers an array of aesthetically pleasing components readily available for use. I also love the classless CSS paradigm that allows for the creation of styled websites through the use of semantic HTML. However, I find that the UI design of many classless CSS frameworks does not align with my aesthetic preferences. In contrast, DaisyUI offers beautifully crafted components and styling. The integration of DaisyUI's design philosophy with classless CSS could serve as an excellent foundation for rapid website development, further minimizing the need for writing extensive classes.

DaisyUI boasts an extensive range of components, surpassing what can be represented through standard HTML elements alone. Consequently, this project is limited to incorporating only those fundamental HTML elements, and does not encompass the entirety of DaisyUI's component library. Nonetheless, this should markedly decrease the volume of coding required.

My preference for DaisyUI stems from several factors that I find lacking in other frameworks:

- Many styling frameworks are tailored to specific JavaScript frameworks, such as React or Vue.
- The reliance on JavaScript for styling deviates from my philosophy of #useThePlatform. I advocate for the intended use of CSS, which inherently supports any framework right out of the box.
- JavaScript frameworks tend to increase the overall bundle size.
- Functionalities such as dropdowns, drawer menus, and modals are often implemented in JavaScript, necessitating extensive code. These can be more efficiently and natively managed with a significantly reduced code footprint and fewer potential bugs using pure CSS.

My selection of daisyUI is rooted in my fondness for its utility and the elegance it brings to code writing. This snippet furthers the efficiency of daisyUI by introducing classless styling as a foundational layer, which can be seamlessly integrated into any project that accommodates Tailwind CSS and daisyUI.
